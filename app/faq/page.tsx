    category: "Core Value & Differentiation",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "What exactly is AutoLenis?",
        a: "AutoLenis is an end-to-end car-buying concierge platform that helps you go from pre-qualification to pickup through a structured workflow—so you can shop smarter, avoid pressure, and reduce surprises.",
      },
      {
        q: "How is AutoLenis different from going directly to a dealer?",
        a: "Direct-to-dealer usually means you negotiate alone inside their environment. AutoLenis shifts leverage by structuring the process so dealers compete for your deal and the paperwork is checked before you commit.",
      },
      {
        q: 'How is AutoLenis different from a "free" broker?',
        a: '"Free" often means the broker\'s incentive is aligned to the dealer payout—not necessarily your best deal. AutoLenis is built to create process leverage and verification, not just referrals.',
      },
      {
        q: "Why would I pay a fee if dealers and brokers claim they can do it for free?",
        a: "Because the real cost is often hidden in price, financing terms, add-ons, time, and mistakes. The fee pays for structure, protection, and execution discipline—the things that reduce expensive surprises.",
      },
      {
        q: "What problems does AutoLenis solve that most people underestimate?",
        a: 'Time waste, negotiation pressure, confusing fees, contract surprises, insurance delays, and "deal drift" where the final numbers change at signing.',
      },
      {
        q: "Is AutoLenis only for people with bad credit?",
        a: "No. AutoLenis is for buyers who want a clean, controlled process—whether your credit is strong or still improving.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will I actually get a better deal?",
        a: "AutoLenis is designed to increase leverage by creating structured competition and reducing friction—but no platform can guarantee a specific price outcome.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do dealers take AutoLenis buyers seriously?",
        a: "Yes—because you show up with a defined request, verified intent, and a process that reduces wasted back-and-forth.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is AutoLenis trying to replace dealerships?",
        a: "No. AutoLenis helps buyers and dealers transact more efficiently—dealers still sell the car; AutoLenis improves the workflow.",
      },
      {
        q: "What's the biggest reason buyers choose AutoLenis?",
        a: "They want control, clarity, and fewer surprises—without spending weeks negotiating and second-guessing paperwork.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: 'Fees, Value, ROI & "Is It Worth It?"',
    questions: [
      {
        q: "What do the fees actually pay for?",
        a: "They pay for a structured system: qualification flow, sourcing/offer workflow, coordination, contract verification (Contract Shield), guided next steps, and concierge support.",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I know the fee isn't just a markup?",
        a: "A markup is hidden in the deal; the AutoLenis fee is explicit. You're paying for process execution and protection instead of guessing where the cost got buried.",
      },
      {
        q: "What if I'm a strong negotiator—why pay?",
        a: "Even strong negotiators get burned in the contract stage. AutoLenis is as much about verification and workflow control as negotiation.",
      },
      {
        q: "What if I can find the same car cheaper myself?",
        a: "Then you can choose it. AutoLenis is valuable when you want deal structure, verification, and a guided path to completion, not endless shopping.",
      },
      {
        q: 'How does AutoLenis prevent "last-minute changes" at signing?',
        a: "By pushing deal confirmation and documentation checks earlier—so discrepancies surface before you're at the desk.",
      },
      {
        q: "What's the real cost of using a free broker?",
        a: "Often: higher total price, financing padding, limited transparency, pressure to close, and reduced recourse when the deal changes.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is AutoLenis worth it for lower-priced cars?",
        a: 'If the cost of mistakes, delays, and contract surprises matters to you, yes. The "value" isn\'t just price—it\'s reducing avoidable risk and time loss.',
      },
      {
        q: "Do I pay if I don't buy?",
        a: "AutoLenis can be structured with different fee triggers; the clean rule is: you pay for work performed and/or when you choose to proceed (exact policy depends on your current fee model).",
      },
      {
        q: "Can AutoLenis save me time?",
        a: "Yes—because it standardizes steps, reduces repeated negotiations, and keeps everything in one guided workflow.",
      },
      {
        q: "What's the simplest reason the fee makes sense?",
        a: 'You\'re buying leverage and protection—two things that are hard to get "free" in a dealer-driven transaction.',
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Trust, Independence & Incentives",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "Does AutoLenis get paid by dealers?",
        a: "AutoLenis should disclose this clearly. The trust standard: if any dealer-side compensation exists, it must be transparent and never compromise buyer confidentiality.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is AutoLenis biased toward certain dealers?",
        a: "The platform is built to route offers through a structured process. If dealer ranking exists, it should be based on objective factors (responsiveness, verified terms, compliance, customer outcomes).",
      },
      {
        q: "How do I know AutoLenis isn't steering me?",
        a: "You keep decision control. AutoLenis presents verified options and helps you complete the transaction; you choose whether to proceed.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will AutoLenis share my information with multiple dealers?",
        a: "Only what's necessary to receive offers and complete the deal. Data minimization and permission-based sharing should be the default.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can a dealer see competing offers?",
        a: "No. Dealers cannot see competitor pricing or identities—this preserves real competition.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Process: Step-by-Step Buyer Journey",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "What are the steps from start to finish?",
        a: "Prequal → vehicle request/shortlist → offers/competition → select best offer → fees/financing → insurance → contract verification → e-sign → pickup/delivery.",
      },
      {
        q: "How long does the process take?",
        a: "It depends on inventory and responsiveness, but AutoLenis is designed to compress delays by standardizing every step and keeping momentum.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I have to talk to dealers?",
        a: "Typically far less than normal. You can keep communication structured and limited until you're ready.",
      },
      {
        q: "What if I'm not sure what vehicle I want?",
        a: "AutoLenis can guide your request into a tight spec—budget, mileage, features, must-haves—so offers are relevant.",
      },
      {
        q: "What if I'm upside down on my current car?",
        a: "AutoLenis can structure the deal path to account for payoff/negative equity considerations—without pretending it disappears.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Offers, Pricing, Negotiation & Competition",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "How do offers work inside AutoLenis?",
        a: "You submit a defined request; dealers respond with structured offers; you compare and select—without typical showroom pressure.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I counteroffer?",
        a: "Yes, if enabled in your flow—AutoLenis can support structured counter terms without turning it into chaos.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I see the full breakdown of costs?",
        a: "That's the standard: vehicle price, fees, taxes, add-ons, financing terms (if applicable) should be clearly presented.",
      },
      {
        q: "What stops a dealer from bait-and-switch?",
        a: "Process controls, documentation checks, and the ability to pause or stop when numbers change. AutoLenis is built to surface changes early.",
      },
      {
        q: "Can I bring my own financing?",
        a: "Yes. You can proceed with outside financing; AutoLenis still adds value on process, contract verification, and coordination.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Contract Shield, Verification & Risk Reduction",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "What is Contract Shield?",
        a: "Contract Shield is a contract verification layer designed to catch inconsistencies, missing disclosures, and unexpected add-ons before you commit.",
      },
      {
        q: "What kinds of issues can Contract Shield catch?",
        a: "Examples: unexpected products/add-ons, fee mismatches, term inconsistencies, missing required disclosures, or payment numbers that don't match the offer.",
      },
      {
        q: "Is Contract Shield legal advice?",
        a: "No. It's a verification and clarity tool—not a substitute for an attorney.",
      },
      {
        q: "What happens if the contract is flagged?",
        a: "The transaction pauses, the issues are identified, and the dealer can correct them—or AutoLenis routes the situation through a controlled review path.",
      },
      {
        q: "Why does contract verification matter so much?",
        a: "Because many bad deals happen at signing—when fatigue, pressure, and complexity are highest.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Insurance, Pickup/Delivery & Completion",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "Can AutoLenis help with insurance?",
        a: "Yes—AutoLenis can support insurance quote workflows or verification so you don't get stuck at delivery.",
      },
      {
        q: "Do I have to buy insurance through AutoLenis?",
        a: "No. You can use your own provider. AutoLenis helps ensure you meet the dealer's proof requirements on time.",
      },
      {
        q: "How does pickup/delivery scheduling work?",
        a: "Once contract and insurance steps are satisfied, the platform coordinates pickup/delivery scheduling and confirms requirements.",
      },
      {
        q: "Will I know exactly what to bring to pickup?",
        a: "That's the goal—AutoLenis should generate a clear checklist so you don't lose the car or delay closing.",
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    category: "Edge Cases, Support & Control",
    questions: [
      {
        q: "What if there are no dealers in my area yet?",
        a: "AutoLenis can route you into a sourcing path—collect your top vehicle preferences and expand outreach until offers can be obtained.",
      },
      {
        q: "What if I change my mind after getting offers?",
        a: "You can revise your request. AutoLenis is designed to keep the process structured, not punitive.",
      },
      {
        q: "What if I find a car on my own—can AutoLenis still help?",
        a: "Yes—AutoLenis can still add value by verifying terms, supporting the contract stage, and guiding you through completion steps.",
      },
      {
        q: "What happens if something goes wrong mid-transaction?",
        a: "AutoLenis gives you a controlled escalation path—documented, trackable, and easier to resolve than ad-hoc texting and calls.",
      },
      {
        q: "Who supports me if I have questions at 9pm?",
        a: "Lenis Concierge can answer immediately about process and your status, and escalate to human support when required.",
      },
      {
        q: "If I summarize: why AutoLenis instead of the old way?",
        a: "Because AutoLenis turns a chaotic, dealer-led negotiation into a structured, verified, buyer-controlled workflow—so you reduce surprises, save time, and complete with confidence.",
      },
    ],
